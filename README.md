# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.
It can also use Python for image processing, leveraging libraries like Pillow and OpenCV. To integrate Python functionalities, you typically set up a separate Python backend (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) and then make API calls from your Next.js frontend to this backend.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
